Homework and Project assignment
Each homework assignment will include written and programing portions.
Both written and programming assignments will be submitted electronically. Submission instructions will be posted with each assignment on Canvas.
Programming assignments will be in Python and will be based on the UC Berkeley The Pac-Man Projects  Links to an external site..
These programming assignments, while fun, only cover a portion of the topics we will study, so they will be supplemented with written problems.
