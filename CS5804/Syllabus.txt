Description
This course will introduce the foundations of modern artificial intelligence (AI) and key ideas and techniques underlying the design of intelligent computer systems. It will focus on concepts that are not only important in the space of AI but are also practically useful in modern applications. We will practice effective methods of reasoning about AI problems, which will generalize beyond the specific topics we study in class. Topics include (but are not limited to) search, game playing, logic, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, robotics and image processing. The techniques you learn in this course apply to a wide variety of artificial intelligence problems and will serve as the foundation for further study in any application area you choose to pursue.

Design and develop intelligent systems by assembling solutions to concrete computational problems that learn from experience.
Implement methods of machine learning using a high-level programming language.
Have a well-informed perspective on what is possible with modern AI methods and what will be possible in the future.
Topics
Search: heuristic search, A*, adversarial search, and game playing.
Probability and learning: reasoning under uncertainty, reinforcement learning, temporal modeling.
Logic and knowledge: propositional, first-order, reasoning, planning, knowledge representation.
Machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and deep learning.
AI Applications: self-driving cars, computer vision, natural language processing, and more.
Prerequisites
The only official prerequisite is CS 3114 (Undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms). You should be comfortable with discrete mathematics, basic probability and statistics, basic logic, computational complexity, data structures, and algorithm analysis.

Homework and Project assignment
Each homework assignment will include written and programing portions.
Both written and programming assignments will be submitted electronically. Submission instructions will be posted with each assignment on Canvas.
Programming assignments will be in Python and will be based on the UC Berkeley The Pac-Man Projects  Links to an external site..
These programming assignments, while fun, only cover a portion of the topics we will study, so they will be supplemented with written problems.
Mini-Project
The goal of the mini-project is for students to practice techniques learned from this or outside the class and work on an AI research project. Students will work on the AI/ML project in a group (Maximum 4 students).

Exams
Exams for this course will be open-book and notes. They will be designed with the intent of testing your ability to understand and apply the concepts we learn about in class, not whether you can memorize them. You should take the exams all by yourselves, should not communicate with others through communication tools like email, phone, chat, zoom, skype, social media, etc during the exams.


Midterm exam 03/13 (Mon) 2:30 pm – 3:45 pm. Exam time 75 minutes.
Final exam 05/10 (Wed) 10:05 am – 12:05 pm. Exam time 2 hours.

* The instructor reserves the right to adjust for unexpected performance on the exams, exceptional contributions to student activities, or other anomalies. The instructor reserves the right to be more lenient in the assignment of letter grades.

Regrading requests
Requests for regrading due to grading errors must be submitted in writing to a TA within one week of the release of grades.

Late assignment policy
Homework & project assignment submitted late without permission will be penalized according to the following formula:

(Penalized score) = (Your raw score) * (1 - 0.1 * (# of days past deadline))

This formula will apply for up to three days, after which the homework will not be accepted and you will receive a grade of zero. Avoid invoking these penalties by starting early and seeking extra help.

Grading scale
Based on the grading breakdown above, each student's final grade for the course will be determined by the final percentage of points earned. The grade ranges are as follows:

 A 	 93.3%–100% 	 A- 	 90.0%–93.3% 	 B+ 	 86.6%–90.0% 	 B 	 83.3%–86.6% 
 B- 	 80.0%–83.3% 	 C+ 	 76.6%–80.0% 	 C 	 73.3%–76.6% 	 C- 	 70.0%–73.3% 
 D+ 	 66.6%–70.0% 	 D 	 63.3%–66.6% 	 D- 	 60.0%–63.3% 	 F 	 00.0%–60.0% 
 

Academic integrity
The Graduate Honor Code pledge that each member of the university community agrees to abide by states: "As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do."

Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code. For additional information about the Honor Code, please visit: https://graduateschool.vt.edu/academics/expectations/graduate-honor-system.html

This course will have a zero-tolerance philosophy regarding plagiarism or other forms of cheating. Your assignments must be your own work, and any external source of code, ideas, or language must be cited to give credit to the original source. I will not hesitate to report incidents of academic dishonesty to the Office of the Graduate Honor System.

Principles of Community
Because the course will include in-class discussions, we will adhere to Virginia Tech's Principles of Community. The first two principles are most relevant:

We affirm the inherent dignity and value of every person and strive to maintain a climate for work and learning based on mutual respect and understanding.
We affirm the right of each person to express thoughts and opinions freely. We encourage open expression within a climate of civility, sensitivity, and mutual respect.
The remaining principles are also important and we will take them seriously as a class.
